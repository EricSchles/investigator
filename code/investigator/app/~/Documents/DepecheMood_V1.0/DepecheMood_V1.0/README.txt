This package contains the three versions of the Lexicon 'DepecheMood' as described in the paper: 

Staiano, J., & Guerini, M. (2014). "DepecheMood: a Lexicon for Emotion Analysis from Crowd-Annotated News". Proceedings of ACL-2014. 

Each version of DepecheMood is built starting from word-by-document matrices either using raw frequencies (DepecheMood_freq.txt), normalized frequencies (DepecheMood_normfreq.txt) or tf-idf (DepecheMood_tfidf.txt). 

The files are tab-separated; each row contains one Lemma#PoS followed by the scores for the following emotions: AFRAID, AMUSED, ANGRY, ANNOYED, DONT_CARE, HAPPY, INSPIRED, SAD.
