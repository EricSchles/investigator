#Intro to Machine Learning

Machine learning is loosely, a set of techniques to teach computers to come up with the rules to a solve a problem, on it's own.  

Feature engineering 



However, really machine learning is just a lot of algorithms to do the following:

Clustering, regression, and classification.  There may be some other fringe techniques that machine learning algorithms attempt to address, but really that's it.  

These three techniques practically match to a few discrete applications:

* clustering -> data exploration

* regression -> prediction, mathematical description of correlation

* classification -> mapping of entities to high level classes

Classically, regression is done via a technique called ordinary least squares.  There are lots of variants here, but for the most part, this is what's taught in classical statistics programs.  However, in machine learning there are lots of different ways to do regression, each has it's merits and deficits, but at the end of the day, most people agree, by expanding the set of techniques, you have a much richer set of things you can predict, understand and address.  The primary use of regression is to do prediction.  However, you can make use of regression to do whatever you like.  Regression produces a mathematical description of the relationships between your input and output data, where the output data is a floating point number (aka from the real numbers) or a set of floating point numbers.  

Classification 


In addition to regression, which is typically the only thing discussed in classical statistics, there is clustering.  

Clustering is the process of partitioning points according to some semantic measure of distance.
