#Our second type of metrics

Now that we have a good idea of how much of the relative population is interested in purchasing commercial sex, let's get a better sense of that population in detail.  There will be two metrics here:

1.  The overall number of posts in the adults section, month over month.
2.  The average rate at which ads are posted on backpage's adult section per hour.

We will measure this second metric every hour, creating a canonical hour per hour.  So we will have a standard rate of posting for 9 am, on tuesdays; for 10am on tuesdays, and so on.  Eventually, we'll get to a set of distributions - one for every hour of every day of the week.  The overall number of posts per month, get's us to larger seaonality affects.  Whereas the hour by hour, gives a sense of how things change within normal scale.
