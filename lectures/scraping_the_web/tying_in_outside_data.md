#Tying in outside data

It's worth noting at this point, that we can take the location data and tie it together with lots and lots of other data sets, like:

* education data
* income data
* ethnographic information
* demographic information
* general crime data
* policy data
* legal data
* and more!

Tying in these other data sets will give us a clearer picture of the types of residents and give us a broader sense of the types of individuals existing in the community.  From there we can understand the set of conditions, leading to rises or falls in the market for commercial sex.  With aid from police departments, we can extend this to understanding the rise and fall of human trafficking.  And then, with a data driven approach, we can apply our policy levers to reduce the markets in size and scale.
